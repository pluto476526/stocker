BE Capstone Project: Inventory Management API
Project Overview:

As a backend developer, your task is to design and implement an Inventory Management API using Django and Django REST Framework. This API will allow users to manage inventory items by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing current inventory levels. You will build a fully functional API that stores inventory data, manages users, and tracks inventory levels, simulating a real-world scenario in managing inventory for a store. The project will cover key aspects such as CRUD operations, database management, and user authentication.
Functional Requirements:

    Inventory Item Management (CRUD):
done        Implement the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) inventory items.
done        Each inventory item should have the following attributes: Name, Description, Quantity, Price, Category, Date Added, and Last Updated.
done        Ensure validation for required fields like Name, Quantity, and Price.

    Users Management (CRUD):
dome        Implement CRUD operations for users.
done        Each user should have a unique Username, Email, and Password.
done        Only authenticated users should be able to manage inventory (i.e., create, update, or delete items).
done        Implement permission checks to ensure that users can only manage their own inventory items.

    View Inventory Levels:
done        Create an endpoint to view the current inventory levels for all items.
done        Display the current Quantity available for each inventory item.
done        Allow optional filters such as Category, Price Range, or Low Stock (e.g., items with quantity below a threshold).

    Track Inventory Changes:
done        Log changes to inventory quantities (e.g., when an item is restocked or sold).
done        Provide an endpoint to view the inventory change history for each item, showing when quantities were updated and by whom.

Technical Requirements:

    Database:
done        Use Django ORM to interact with the database.
done        Define models for Inventory Items and Users.
done        Ensure that inventory items are associated with the users who manage them.

    Authentication:
done        Implement user authentication using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system.
done        Users must be logged in to manage inventory items (i.e., create, update, or delete).
done        Optionally, implement token-based authentication (JWT) for more secure API access.

    API Design:
done        Use Django Rest Framework (DRF) to design and expose API endpoints.
done        Follow RESTful principles by using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
done        Ensure proper error handling, with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad request).

    Deployment:
done        Deploy the API on Heroku or PythonAnywhere.
done        Ensure the API is accessible, secure, and performs well in the deployed environment.

    Pagination and Sorting:
done        Implement pagination for viewing inventory items to handle large datasets efficiently.
done        Provide sorting options, such as sorting items by Name, Quantity, Price, or Date Added.

Stretch Goals (Optional):

done    Low Stock Alerts: Implement a feature where the system sends alerts (via email or in-app) when inventory levels drop below a certain threshold.
done    Inventory Categories: Allow users to manage inventory categories dynamically, with the ability to add, update, and delete categories.
done    Supplier Management: Add functionality for users to manage suppliers, with a relationship between inventory items and suppliers for tracking where items were sourced from.
done    Inventory Reports: Generate detailed inventory reports that show total value of inventory, stock levels, and sales/restocking history.
to do   Barcode Scanning Integration: Implement support for barcode scanning, allowing users to add or update inventory by scanning item barcodes.
done    Stock Reordering: Implement a feature that automatically suggests restocking certain items when their quantity drops below a predefined level.
done    Multi-Warehouse Support: Extend the system to manage inventory across multiple warehouses, with separate inventory for each warehouse.
